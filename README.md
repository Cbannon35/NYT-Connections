# Connections PWA

[Live App](https://connections-lyart.vercel.app/)

Hi, welcome to the Connections PWA repository. This is a Progressive Web App recreation (dare i say improvement?!) of the NYT Connections game. 

This project is a work in progress, but right now everything is functional. Progress is stored in indexedDB, so you can close the app and come back to it later.

The code is a little rough... don't say I didn't warn you! I'm working on cleaning it up, but I'm also working on adding more features.

View the api [here](https://github.com/Cbannon35/NYT-Connections-API/blob/main/README.md)

## Loose TODO list:
- [ ] Add animations on guess submit
- [ ] Add user accounts w/ authentication -> connect to MongoDB
- [ ] Add ability to create custom games
- [ ] Add 'Lab' to train AI agents for solving / creating games
